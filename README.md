# bluedog-sam
Browser-based client for editing PDFs.  This html file allows users to merge PDFs and re-order/remove pages. This script does not store nor, upload your documents.

To use: 
1. Download the bluedog.html file -- click the green code button and select download zip.
2. Uzip the folder and open 'bluedog.html' using Chrome browswer
3. Use the upload file input field on the left to upload a pdf**, repeat with all pdfs which you want to rearrange
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3a. ** any encrypted signed PDFs will not be processed.  For those types of documents (say something like AF910) you will need to open the document in Adobe Acrobat and print the document using Microsoft Print to PDF.  This will create a non-encrypted version of the PDF which *should* work. 
4. Use mouse tp rearrange pages, or delete pages you don't want with the 'X' button
5. If it works share with someone else who might need it
6. Provide feedback mcconkey@gmail.com

Known Issues:
* Some PDFs (like signed/encrypted PDFs) only show up blank.
* It's ugly! I know!
